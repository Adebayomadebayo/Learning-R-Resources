**What is this?**
This is function plays a rap adlib when it is called. It is useful if you have a script that takes a while to run, and want to be notified when it is finished. The package currently includes 52 different sounds from 34 artists, the majority of which are pulled from The Rap Board by LP Riel. I use it when I have long scripts to run and I want to feel amused when they are ready hahha

The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of tools that solve common problems with factors, including changing the order of levels or the values.

# Creating Packages
## [Create your own R package-R Packages by Hadley Wickham  Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/)

**What is this?**
Excerpt from e-book: Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this book you’ll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn’t matter if your first version isn’t perfect as long as the next version is better.

## [Writing an R package from scratch by Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from blog: This tutorial is not about making a beautiful, perfect R package. This tutorial is about creating a bare-minimum R package so that you don’t have to keep thinking to yourself, “I really should just make an R package with these functions so I don’t have to keep copy/pasting them like a goddamn luddite.” Seriously, it doesn’t have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time. (n.b. this is my attitude about all reproducibility.)
