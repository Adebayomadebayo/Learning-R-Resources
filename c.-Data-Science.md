I separate this section from the statistics one because when I needed to learn how to run statistics in R, I would feel frustrated when the documents I found were not directly telling me about specific tests I need to learn about. It may not be generalizable but it makes sense to me now. Sorry!

## [A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. Foreword by Kelly S. McConville](https://moderndive.com/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from ebook: Over the course of this book, you will develop your ‚Äúdata science toolbox,‚Äù equipping yourself with tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression.     

In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today‚Äôs world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are used to convey relationships within data. In general, we‚Äôll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book.

## [R for data Science by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site:
This is the website for ‚ÄúR for Data Science‚Äù. This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You‚Äôll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you‚Äôll learn how to clean data and draw plots‚Äîand many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You‚Äôll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You‚Äôll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis with R Roger D. Peng](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/) üíØ 
**What is this?**
Excerpt from e-booK: This book covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data with R. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data you have. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing informative data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: This is a graduate economics seminar taught by Grant McDermott at the University of Oregon.

Please read the syllabus before you go through any of the lectures. This will detail software requirements and installation, and give you a better sense of the aims and scope of the course. I also have an "FAQ" section at the end that covers frequently asked questions (or, at least, potentially asked questions). Speaking of which, here follow answers to some questions that are more specifically related to this repo.
