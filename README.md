# Learning-R-resources

Since I got introduced to R, I have been accumulating resources that could help me and other on this process. In the past 2 years I have taken the role to teach R to people in my lab and university. Last semester I, for the first time, opened my class to people outside of the school. It was an awesome experience and I would like to continue doing it. 

I used to keep track of these sources in a private Trello but honestly why should I just keep it to myself. I hope it helps y'all!

Best,

Joscelin Rocha-Hidalgo
