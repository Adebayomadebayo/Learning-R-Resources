Here you can find a list of resources that have and continue helping me in my process of learning/ teaching R.
# Learning-R-Resources

Since I got introduced to R, I have been accumulating resources that could help me and others in this process. In the past two years, I have taken the role of teaching R to people in my lab and university. Last semester I, for the first time, opened my class to people outside of the school. It was an incredible experience, and I would like to continue doing it.

I used to keep track of these sources in a private Trello, but honestly, why should I just keep it to myself? I hope it helps you all!
