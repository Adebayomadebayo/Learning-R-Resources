## [Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century by Russell Poldrack](https://statsthinking21.org/) ðŸ’¯ 
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world. Itâ€™s a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use a set of tools to acheive very specific goals. This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of statistical thinking â€” a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and make decisions and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world. It also brings to bear current methods that have only become feasible in light of the amazing increases in computational power that have happened in the last few decades. Analyses that would have taken years in the 1950â€™s can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer, and this power unleashes the ability to use computer simulation to ask questions in new and powerful ways.

## [R course by Page Piccinini](https://pagepiccinini.com/r-course/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from course: The goal of this course is to give you the skills to do the statistics that are in current published papers, and make pretty figures to show off your results. While we will go over the mathematical concepts behind the statistics, this is NOT meant to be a classical statistics class. We will focus more on making the connection between the mathematical equation and the R code, and what types of variables fit into each slot of the equation.

## [STAT 545 Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R by Jenny Bryan](https://stat545.com/) ðŸ’¯ 
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis except for statistical modelling and inference. This might strike you as strange, given Râ€™s statistical roots. First, let me assure you we believe that modelling and inference are important. But the world already offers a lot of great resources for doing statistics with R.

## [Model Summary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/)
**What is this?**
modelsummary creates beautiful and customizable tables to summarize statistical models in R.
Results from several models are presented side-by-side. Tables can be echoed to the R console or viewed in the RStudio Viewer. They can be saved to HTML, PDF, Text/Markdown, LaTeX, MS Word, RTF, JPG, and PNG formats. Tables can easily be embedded in dynamic document pipelines like Rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave.

## [Test your model!! Performance package](https://easystats.github.io/performance/index.html)

**What is this?**
Test if your model is a good model!
The primary goal of the performance package is to provide utilities for computing indices of model quality and goodness of fit. This includes measures like r-squared (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE) or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), but also functions to check (mixed) models for overdispersion, zero-inflation, convergence or singularity.

## [Conversion in Psychology-MsC course](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv-f2f/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: 
This book contains the quantitative research methods materials for students on the MSc Conversion in Psychological Studies/Science. The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates. Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.

The focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study. Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions. To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminology.

## [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition by Solomon Kurz](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from e-book: This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreathâ€™s (2020a) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan. My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul BÃ¼rknerâ€™s brms package (BÃ¼rkner, 2017, 2018, 2020c), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019). So weâ€™ll be using those methods, too.

## [Generalized Additive Models by Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: The following provides a brief introduction to generalized additive models and some thoughts on getting started within the R environment. It doesnâ€™t assume much more than a basic exposure to regression, and maybe a general idea of R, though not necessarily any particular expertise. The presentation is of a very applied nature, and such that the topics build upon the familiar and generalize to the less so, with the hope that one can bring the concepts they are comfortable with to the new material. The audience in mind is a researcher with typical applied science training.

**What is this?**
Excerpt from ebook: We cover qualitative approaches, where you search for common themes within spoken or written material, and quantitative approaches where you use one or more measures to predict an outcome. Each week you will work in groups to solve problems and work towards a practical presentation of your work at the end of the semester (worth 20% of the mark), with two pieces of written coursework during the module (80% of the mark).
