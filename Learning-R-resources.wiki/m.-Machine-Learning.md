Here I will be adding resources that have Machine learning as their main topic. All levels will be added here. I will try to add the beginner ones towards the top. 

## [Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse by Alison Hill & Garrett Grolemund](https://conf20-intro-ml.netlify.app/) ðŸ’¯ 
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: This is the website for a two-day workshop offered January 27-28 at rstudio::conf 2020 in San Francisco, CA. This workshop provided a gentle introduction to machine learning and to tidymodels.

## [Supervised Machine Learning case studies in R by Julia Silge](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from course:Predictive modeling, or supervised machine learning, is a powerful tool for using data to make predictions about the world around us. Once you understand the basic ideas of supervised machine learning, the next step is to practice your skills so you know how to apply these techniques wisely and appropriately. In this course, you will work through four case studies using data from the real world; you will gain experience in exploratory data analysis, preparing data so it is ready for predictive modeling, training supervised machine learning models using tidymodels, and evaluating those models.
