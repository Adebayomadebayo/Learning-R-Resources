Here I added resources aimed exclusively for other people who are teaching R.


## [rstudio4edu A Handbook for Teaching and Learning with R and RStudio by Desirée De Leon & Alison Hill](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/)
**What is it?**
Excerpt from handbook: This handbook was inspired by the Handbook for Teaching and Learning with Jupyter- a book written by and for educators who teach data science. It is a thoughtful and inspiring resource for all educators, with a focus on the Python ecosystem. We aimed to create a similar resource for educators working with the R and RStudio ecosystem.

## [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/)
**What is it?**

Excerpt from website: The psyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology has successfully made the transition to teaching reproducible research using R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Our curriculum now emphasizes essential ‘data science’ graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports. Students learn about probability and inference through data simulation as well as by working with real datasets.

This website contains our open materials for teaching reproducible research.

## [Teaching Research Methods in R](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/rminrinpsy.html)
**What is it?**
Excerpt from site: This is a crowd-sourced list of uses of R to teach research methods in Psychology, and a link to Creative Commons teaching materials, where these are available. The year teaching in R was adopted at undergraduate and postgraduate level is also recorded, where known. Where there are no materials, but the organization’s name has a link, this is a link to evidence that R is used.
