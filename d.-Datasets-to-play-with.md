After I learned to do some fun things in R, I noticed that I needed datasets to practice my new skills. I know there are some already built in R (added a nice list here) but I also wanted to "choose" something that aligns more with what I do or may enjoy learning about, so here are other ones I found too.

## [Datasets found in R](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html)
**What is this?**
This is an archive of datasets distributed within R. I love this list because it is alphabetized and I can also get the CSVs from it.
